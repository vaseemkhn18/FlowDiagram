        ## Overview
        
        FlowDiagram is a Python Library to create Sequence Diagram in Command Line or Image (.PNG)
        
        ### Setup
        
        #### Installtion via PIP:
            pip install flowdiagram
        
        #### Manual Installation:
        This package requires:
        -  multipledispatch==0.6.0
        -  six==1.16.0
        -  Pillow==8.2.0
        
        First install above packages
        Download tar.gz from pypi and untar it
        Go to untarred directory
        Execute below command
            python setup.py install
        
        ## Usage
        
        Using this library we can generate Sequence Diagram on Command Line or a Image (.PNG) via both python script or flow text file.
        
        ### Generate Sequence Diagram on Command Line via flow text file
        
        #### Flow Text File Example
        ```
        
        ```
        
        
        The ``->`` is used to draw a message between two
        participants.
        Participants do not have to be explicitly declared.
        
        To have a dotted arrow, you use ``-->``
        
        It is also possible to use ``<-`` and ``<--``.
        That does not change the drawing, but may improve readability.
        Note that this is only true for sequence diagrams, rules are different for the other diagrams.
